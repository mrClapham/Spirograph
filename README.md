# Spirograph
A JavaScript spirograph

To run tests install the Karma command line interface as a global:

```
$ npm install -g karma-cli
```

To contribute use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for commits:

```
$ npm install -g semantic-release-cli
```
To make semantic release commits simpler use Commitizen:

```
$ npm install -g commitizen
```
